# Community-Detection-algorithms-comparison

In this study, we considered many standard community detection algorithms like Louvain algorithm, Greedy modularity algorithm, label propagation algorithm, Girvan Newman algorithm. A new model is also proposed for getting the communities of a graph. The core of the proposed model is hub The comparative analysis for these algorithms are performed based on parameters like modularity, coverage, time required, and performance. The performance achieved by our algorithm is found to be satisfactory.
